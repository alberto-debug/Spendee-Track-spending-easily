# Financial Tracking Feature for Spring Boot App

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the Financial Tracking feature for your Spring Boot application! This feature adds a powerful financial management system to your app, enabling users to seamlessly manage their income and expenses. Built on top of your existing authentication system using Spring Security, JWT, and password encoding, it ensures that only authenticated users can access and manage their financial data.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Spring Boot CLI or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- Basic knowledge of Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA
- Authentication system in place using Spring Security, JWT, and password encoding

## 🛠️ Entities

You need two main entities: Income and Expense, or a generic Transaction entity.

### Option 1: Separate Income and Expense Entities

- **Income**: Represents income transactions with attributes like source, amount, and date.
- **Expense**: Represents expense transactions with attributes like category, amount, and date.

### Option 2: Generic Transaction Entity

- **Transaction**: A single entity to handle both income and expense transactions, with attributes like type (INCOME or EXPENSE), description, amount, date, and user association.

## 🔧 Repositories

Create repositories for your entities to interact with the database.

- **IncomeRepository**: Methods to save, retrieve, and delete income transactions.
- **ExpenseRepository**: Methods to save, retrieve, and delete expense transactions.
- **TransactionRepository**: Methods to save, retrieve, and delete transactions, with additional filtering by type and user.

## 🧱 Services

Create services to handle business logic.

- **IncomeService**: Manages income transactions (add, retrieve, delete).
- **ExpenseService**: Manages expense transactions (add, retrieve, delete).
- **TransactionService**: Manages transactions (add, retrieve, delete) and generates financial summaries.

## 🌐 Controllers

Create controllers to handle HTTP requests.

- **IncomeController**: Handles requests related to income transactions (add, list, delete).
- **ExpenseController**: Handles requests related to expense transactions (add, list, delete).
- **FinancialController**: Handles requests related to financial summaries and transactions.

## 🔒 Security Configuration

Update your security configuration to protect financial endpoints.

- **SecurityConfig**: Configures Spring Security to allow only authenticated users to access financial endpoints while permitting unauthenticated access to authentication endpoints.

## 📊 Financial Summary

Optional: Add a service to calculate monthly summaries.

- **FinancialSummaryService**: Provides methods to calculate total income, expenses, and remaining balance for a given user and month.

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

Integrate with your React frontend using the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/incomes` - List all income transactions for the authenticated user.
- `POST /api/incomes` - Add a new income transaction for the authenticated user.
- `DELETE /api/incomes/{id}` - Delete an income transaction for the authenticated user.
- `GET /api/expenses` - List all expense transactions for the authenticated user.
- `POST /api/expenses` - Add a new expense transaction for the authenticated user.
- `DELETE /api/expenses/{id}` - Delete an expense transaction for the authenticated user.
- `GET /api/summary` - Get a financial summary for the authenticated user.
- `GET /api/summary/{year}/{month}` - Get a monthly financial summary for the authenticated user.

## 🌈 Optional Features

### Monthly Financial Summary

Modify the financial summary service to include a method that calculates the total income, expenses, and balance for a specific month and year.
